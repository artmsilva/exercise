This is an open ended and open book problem. We encourage you to ask questions.

Create an article page from data fetched from the `getArticleContent` function in `./api/article.js`.

```json
// example of an object in the array
{
  "_id": "O23JTX787658I7CD6U3235ENM",
  "content": "Space suddenly seems a little more reachable â€” at least, for those who have cash to burn.",
  "type": "header",
  "level": 1
}
```
