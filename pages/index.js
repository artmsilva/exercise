/*
Instructions: 

"getArticle" is a function that returns a promise that resolves to an array containing content for an article.

Each of these content elements are of type "text".  Build a simple view that shows these content elements
using markup that is as semantic as possible.

Start simple. Just render the elements with little or no style and iterate!
